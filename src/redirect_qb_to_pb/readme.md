# Redirect qb to pb

> [QuickBackupM](https://github.com/TISUnion/QuickBackupM) is a classic saves backup plugin. Recently, [PrimeBackup](https://github.com/TISUnion/PrimeBackup) has become its alternative. Due to historical reasons, many servers still have the historical habit of using `!!qb`. Since PrimeBackup does not support the multi-command prefix function, this plugin was made to solve this problem.

You can now use `!!qb` equivalent to `!!pb`.

> [!WARNING]
> There maybe incompatibilities with the QuickBackupM plugin.
